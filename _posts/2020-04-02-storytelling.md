## Plot and storylines

(plot description)

One of our goals this semester was to improve the storyline in such a way that it could serve as additional motivation for the participants to get engaged in activities proposed by the chatbot. Thus, first of all, existing narrative ideas should be organised into a united plot. Secondly, the storyline should be better integrated with the existing tasks and give the users a sense of progression as they successfully move from one task to another. Thirdly, additional story variants should be created. 

The main storyline can be described as follows. The users regain consciousness and find themselves in a strange and unfamiliar place. They find out then that they are on a spaceship, while aliens, who kidnapped them, now want to interrogate them to figure out a way to remove all humans from the Earth. This makes it clear that the final goal of the participants should be an escape from the spaceship, which is possible only with the help of two additional characters: Elias and Harriet. 

We motivate the importance of linguistic tasks within described narrative by emphasizing that English language is a perfect tool to provide evidence that participants are proficient in one of the most spoken languages on the planet and, thus, are humans and not the aliens. Only this can persuade hacker from the Earth to help them. 

Storyblocks and tasks are combined in such a way that successful completion of each task leads to the users obtaining a piece of the code that will let them continue the quest. The storyline consists of introduction, conclusion and two intermediate story blocks that are presented in-between the tasks. In case the task was failed, a respectful story block gets presented asking if the users would like to do the task one more time.  If all three tasks were completed, the story session ends with the users escaping the spaceship on a shuttle they manage to find. If participants fail the last task, they get captured by the aliens and can only start their escape from the very beginning. 

In addition to the main storyline of the escape scenario, several session variants were designed. Each of these story variants consists of 4 blocks of text, in which the introduction and the conclusion stay the same as in the first storyline to keep the original setting and story frame. Meanwhile, the story in between differs with respect to the different escape rooms, the items to interact with, like a map, and the incidents, like a slipping team mate.

The story variants are created to keep the story engaging and interesting for users who have already interacted with the application but want to go on with their learning experience, even for those, who have already successfully escaped.
